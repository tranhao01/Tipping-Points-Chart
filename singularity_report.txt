Data points: n=60
Time range: [0.0 .. 59.0]

Model comparison (lower is better):
- exponential: RSS=30330.2, AIC=377.533, BIC=381.722, params: A=13.1, b=0.04351
- logistic: RSS=4801.33, AIC=268.938, BIC=275.221, params: K=109.9, r=0.12, c=12.92
- hyperbolic: RSS=7.49017, AIC=-118.845, BIC=-112.562, params: C=1.325e+15, alpha=6.209, tstar=177

Best model by BIC/AIC: hyperbolic
Estimated t* (finite-time): 177
Alpha: 6.20914; C: 1.32478e+15
Note: Real systems often bend to logistic before reaching t*.

Structural break (two-segment OLS on ln X ~ t):
- Best split index k=27 at timeâ‰ˆ27.0, improvement in RSS=5.71854

Early-warning (rolling on g(t)):
- Window size: 15
- Last lag-1 autocorr: -0.216
- Last variance: 0.0002022
Rising autocorr/variance may indicate approaching tipping.
